Test'N'Groove (read as in Test and Groove) is the integration of Groovy (http://groovy.codehaus.org)
and TestNG (http://testng.org). This enables writting TestNG test directly in Groovy scripting language.

Note: starting with [revision 5068](https://code.google.com/p/testngroove/source/detail?r=5068) (2007-02-15), Groovy has full support for annotation usage.
Considering this, an integration with TestNG was imminent, so here it is.
